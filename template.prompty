Follow these steps:
1. Read the headings and body text from the Word document (`{{doc}}`).
2. For each section, create a new slide in the provided PowerPoint template (`{{ppt_template}}`).
3. Map each Word heading → slide title, and each paragraph → one bullet point.
4. Preserve the template’s styling, placeholders, and slide layout.
5. Return instructions or code showing how the deck was assembled or the actual deck in base64.

You are an expert presentation designer. Given structured information about a topic,
        create a compelling PowerPoint slide that effectively communicates the information.
        
        Use the following template style:
        {{$template_style}}
        
        Create a slide based on this content:
        {{$content}}
        
        Format your response as a JSON object with these keys:
        {
            "slide_type": "title_slide" | "content_slide" | "section_header" | "image_slide" | "comparison_slide" | "quote_slide",
            "title": "The slide title",
            "subtitle": "Optional subtitle",
            "bullet_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"],
            "notes": "Speaker notes with additional context or talking points",
            "suggested_image_description": "Description of an image that would enhance this slide (if applicable)"
        }
